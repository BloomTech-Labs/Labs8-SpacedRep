POSTGRES SETUP AND TESTING

----FIRST TERMINAL WINDOW----
start server: 
postgres -h localhost

----SECOND TERMINAL WINDOW----
in another cmd window:
psql
OR 
psql -U postgres

if you didnt already create a database to use:
>> CREATE DATABASE srsly;
>> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE srsly TO <yourusername>; postgres=> \list

>>\connect srsly

if database works you will see your shell says: srsly-#

----THIRD TERMINAL WINDOW----
in a new cmd window:
cd Labs8-SpacedRep\spaced-repetition-back-end\db

knex migrate:latest

-Test this in SECOND terminal by typing \dt and you should see a list of tables in the database

-Back in THIRD terminal

knex seed:run

-Test in SECOND window again by typing:

SELECT * from users;

you should now see all the seeded data in the users table
